## Usage

```bash
$ docker run -p 8080:80 -d jakejarvis/wordpress-beta:latest
```

For a full plug-and-play setup, you can also reference an [example `docker-compose.yml` file](docker-compose.yml) I've provided, which includes this WordPress Beta container, [MariaDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb), [phpMyAdmin](https://hub.docker.com/r/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/), and [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/). Just run `docker-compose up` in this directory and visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to see the magic happen!

You can also refer to the [official WordPress image](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/), which this repository was forked from, for even more options â€”Â everything there is cross-compatible.

The [WordPress Beta Tester](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/) plugin can be added after setup to join the nightly (alpha) or trunk (literally the [latest commits](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk)) release channels (at your own risk ðŸ˜¬).
